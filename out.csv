cweagans,2014-07-30 01:42:08,wanting to include Bootstrap in a Drupal distribution that working on Because using the Drupal org packaging system I cannot include Bootstrap because the is not compatible with is what all code on Drupal org must be licensed as per our license policy http drupal org licensing I was wondering if be willing to either release Bootstrap under another license parallel to the Apache that would be compatible with our packaging system or license Bootstrap specifically to Drupal org contributors under a compatible license 
caniszczyk,2012-02-17 23:01:02,I believe the code on Drupal org is under the or later which is fine software can therefore be included in projects because the license accepts our software into works http www apache org licenses html 
cweagans,2012-02-17 23:02:17,Nope everything is licensed as right now When the packaging system puts things together it includes the license and cannot be relicensed as 
Crell,2012-02-17 23:12:29,Drupal org is We do not permit code at this time APL is only compatible with not cweagans you may want to see if we can allow a library via the for distributions not sure if that team will accept a library in that case If not then yes something would be necessary 
caniszczyk,2012-02-17 23:55:22,all for finding ways to make this work pretty much no chance the bootstrap license will ever change Is there a way we can have Drupal move to the newer version of http www gnu org licenses be willing to put in some cycles to talk to the right people over in Drupal land to make this work 
cweagans,2012-02-18 00:01:36,no chance of licensing it under an additional That is it would be concurrently available under APL and other license compatible with our packaging If not guess that Crell is at least one of the people to talk to the licensing guy for the Drupal Association probably know who else to talk to about it I imagine that there will be a significant amount of pushback on this though changing the license of Drupal and every single contrib project on Drupal org is no easy task 
Crell,2012-02-18 00:09:13,Changing license from to would be a very simple change administratively legally and a monumental task culturally not something going to happen any time soon although I would like to see it happen eventually for various reasons 
caniszczyk,2012-02-18 00:11:26,I understand that pain well the GPL I would advise that the drupal org community look at having module authors choose between the or license this would then allow folks to embed Apache licensed code into their projects without issues The is a very liberal license In the end all for making this work somehow I mean according the Drupal FAQ able to redistribute Drupal under the or license of the GPL so I see why this is an issue to begin with http drupal org licensing 
Crell,2012-02-18 00:24:25,Because there are libraries out there that people want to be able to integrate as well unfortunate subtly involved that I have the misfortune of having been the point person to sort out We want the code coming off of Drupal org to always be legally compatible with code coming off of Drupal org Many modules bridge to other party libraries Some of those are only some are only Therefore to get the widest possible compatibility we require that Drupal org code be The option of which to use is made by the receiver NOT the module developer It cannot be or else you could end up with a module and a module both on d o and then just a total fail because you distribute them together Yes this causes issues for code Bootstrap is not the first time seen this At some point I do want us to move to but that is not on the table for the foreseeable future Licensing changes for Drupal org are not worth discussing here as that boat takes too long to turn 
cweagans,2012-02-18 04:20:38,I suspected that a licensing change for Drupal org code would be painful but I had to hold out hope So given that is there any chance at all of distributing Bootstrap under an additional license that might be a little more friendly to our packaging I know of at least three projects that would love to be able to include Bootstrap but cannot due to the license http drupal org project and http drupal org sandbox rerooting and http drupal org project droptracker I suspect that more projects would use Bootstrap if it were easily included by our packaging system 
mdo,2012-02-18 04:33:33,ask about this stuff 
cweagans,2012-02-18 04:59:55,been commenting on this issue already It would be really awesome if Bootstrap could be distributed under anything compatible with the license along with the current Apache license 
mdo,2012-02-18 07:18:27,Totally missed that Sounds like not really an issue 
cweagans,2012-02-18 18:39:42,I follow still certainly an issue please read all of the comments on this issue 
caniszczyk,2012-02-18 23:28:00,Changing the license of Bootstrap practical given that the is already a very permissive license and already allows Bootstrap to be embedded in all sorts of commercial and applications I would advise that the Drupal community take a better stance on adopting the and the mixing of libraries Technically Bootstrap can be considered a separate program in case a so mixing it be an issue depending on your interpretation Also Bootstrap can be used by folks who run Drupal modules on their own server only in the case of drupal org that this is an issue It would be good to start turning the boat sooner than later nice to give your users a choice in the matter 
mdo,2012-02-18 23:30:33,Sorry I meant to say that this sound like an issue we can resolve easily To expand on that though all for anyone and everyone using Bootstrap Licensing issues suck ass and like to avoid any issue if possible If thinks kosher for us to have two licenses so be it 
caniszczyk,2012-02-18 23:38:31,Technically everyone can given the terms of the just that the puts drupal org in a precarious situation since they are distributing code which triggers the nasty in the The is a permissive license that is great for commercial development and proprietary redistribution Code that is distributed under the and other permissive licenses can be integrated into proprietary products and redistributed under a broad variety of other terms 
cweagans,2012-02-18 23:40:14,not suggesting the the license for Bootstrap be changed suggesting that released under a That is when users download it be able to choose between the Apache license and other This practice is common and is used by an jQuery and Sizzle library that jQuery uses for jQuery is released under the MIT license AND the GPL Sizzle is released under the MIT GPL and BSD licenses When you download you choose which license going to use The problem with changing the license for the Drupal community is a very very large one Not only would we be changing the license for core but also be changing the license for every single other module theme and installation profile posted on Drupal org There are currently around projects on Drupal org and making that change is a ordeal guess 
cweagans,2012-02-18 23:42:04,That is anyone who is still using Bootstrap under the Apache license can continue to do so If Bootstrap were released under another license addition to the Apache then users downloading Bootstrap could choose to use that new license instead if they wanted to 
caniszczyk,2012-02-18 23:51:05,When back in the office next week look at what we can do We may be able to work something out where we license Bootstrap specifically to Drupal org contributors only under a compatible license can you email me at com to start this 
realityking,2012-02-19 00:36:34,some talk of making the next Joomla admin template based on Bootstrap final and especially the license situation been discussed at all yet but pretty much in the same boat If we make Joomla we basically force all extensions to change their license as well some of them probably have some only code Dual licensing bootstrap and or would certainly be very helpful 
cweagans,2012-02-21 22:53:15,For anyone interested the related issue about adding Bootstrap to the Drupal org packaging system is here http drupal org node 
WraithKenny,2012-03-01 17:43:51,WordPress suffers the same doom as Drupal and Joomla Dual Licensing would be awesome 
gagarine,2012-03-21 01:37:12,I agree dual licensing is a good way to make bootstrap available to only code and keep the advantage of the Apache license 
norrs,2012-06-08 09:12:18,Is there any new thoughts of making bootstrap dual licensed so we can easily use it in our licensed What is the down side of dual licensing bootstrap seen from twitter view of 
sun,2012-10-02 23:15:52,This issue seems to block adoption of Bootstrap in Drupal WordPress Joomla and potentially many more web frameworks content management systems Is there any chance to resurrect this The common solution to combat the problem space is indeed to the code under and XYZ from might be able to provide assistance on details as they just recently from APL to GPL note that was not 
evo42,2012-10-02 23:26:56,forwarding the licensing question to he knows all details about the changes regarding and was talking to a lot of ppl regarding licence issues 
caniszczyk,2012-10-02 23:29:59,This is still on my radar and will be part of the work of moving bootstrap into its own organization My thoughts are to use the MIT license I dislike the GPL and the mess it causes The fun part of this effort will be getting every contributors explicit permission to make the change https github com twitter bootstrap graphs contributors I will this issue and put it in the community category assigned to me 
evo42,2012-10-02 23:39:45,that sounds like fun for all contributors were to sign a CLA before a pull request was accepted the one hand this maybe scares some people a bit sign stuff for open print sign scan send but was then quite easy http org contribution php 
sun,2012-10-03 00:16:59,MIT sounds most sensible to me essentially removing almost all license restrictions except for the original author copyright statement I know whether involves the same challenges and requirements as In any case I can only guess that considered that option too so eager to learn what insights can share with us 
sprice,2012-10-03 00:19:06,fwiw jQuery recently the GPL license from their blog jquery com as it seems created a number of problems According to the linked blog post other projects are to take a jQuery Foundation project make changes and it under the the same be done with Drupal using How does the Drupal project integrate jQuery now that it is MIT 
cweagans,2012-10-03 00:34:14,projects can pull in MIT and BSD projects since MIT and BSD can be relicensed as projects can NOT pull in Apache licensed projects since APL projects cannot be relicensed can be relicensed as but we are not a project the purpose of this issue Distributing Boot strap under the MIT license would allow Drupal Joomla and Wordpress to use Bootstrap and be fully compliant with the licenses 
cweagans,2012-10-03 00:28:11,As a sidenote I wrote an email still sitting in my Gmail drafts folder has been for that is addressed to all Bootstrap contributors asking their opinion on relicensing Bootstrap AFAIK this is a necessary step but I been able to move forward on it asked me to not send that 
sprice,2012-10-03 00:33:28,ah thanks for clearing that 
cweagans,2012-10-03 02:19:23,also like to note that trying to get a theme into Drupal core in this issue http drupal org node I want to rush things but the deadline for a working patch is and our feature freeze is If Bootstrap can be relicensed by then be in a very very good position 
mdo,2012-10-31 04:33:15,Where do we stand on this 
tardyp,2013-01-21 11:27:37,We have the same situation for For that reason we had to switch to fundation but it is not as complete as bootstrap and has much less ecosystem So we really would like to have this solved 
tsi,2013-01-21 12:52:10,FWIW Joomla GPL includes Bootstrap

cweagans,2013-03-20 16:43:43,We should not be discussing making a license change without getting input from contributors regardless of if that is or is not legal However technically we do that anyways because there is no copyright assignment agreement that is required to contribute to Bootstrap so contributors still own their code and we just relicense that without their consent 
caniszczyk,2013-03-20 16:46:17,Indeed The quickest way to do this would be to get contributors to affirm that they are willing to license their contributions to the MIT license This could even be done on this issue if I think about it to log it as public record

melvingb,2013-03-29 21:12:26,phpBB is also under the license is there a way to make compatible the apache 
cweagans,2013-03-29 21:15:54,No The apache license is not compatible with Version of the GPL at all hence this issue 
melvingb,2013-03-29 21:42:35,For bootstrap version change the license or continue the I designed a style based on bootstrap but also style is under the license but is not compatible with the license of the bootstrap That is a serious problem for which we are designing or using narrow framework 
fhars,2013-03-30 12:08:10,In copyright terms no answer usually has to be counted as a strict to relicensing To be safe you must either collect a yes from every contributor or rewrite all code contributed by people you cannot get a yes from at least for contributions of sufficient creative value a maybe not for typo fixes or so but the true limit can only be determined by a See for example how OpenStreetMap handled their relicensing http wiki openstreetmap org wiki

cweagans,2013-04-03 06:24:03,I think OT in this thread You should consult an IP lawyer or open a separate issue It looks like we have a ton of yes and care votes and two No votes Do we need a unanimous response from the contributors to make this Or can they be overruled since other people are in How do we handle I guess what asking is is this a Or is this a everyone to sign off on the 
melvingb,2013-04-03 17:39:10,It is the same question 
mdo,2013-04-03 18:55:12,I believe compatible licenses but that requires research on your own end hold me to that As I understand it everyone has to say yes might know better about what to do next but how understood it Does your list of contributors include everyone from the pull Lots of folks have contributed there as well 
millette,2013-04-03 18:58:31,If someone says no to his contribution you can always rewrite that contribution or remove it Better yet understand why against the change and try to change their mind 
melvingb,2013-04-03 23:16:27,Ok thanks 
tierra,2013-04-03 23:29:48,Given the response so far I doubt that most of the responses turn into a if it comes down to either that or having their contributions removed At least one of those responses obviously fully understand that Bootstrap is already under a permissive license and that this change is to GPL projects not hurt them 
memht,2013-04-14 17:48:37,tierra if the license change i cannot include it in my projects hurting me and everyone else using similar licences 
jrobeson,2013-04-17 16:48:27,any updates on 
jcheng5,2013-04-26 16:29:05,Here are the two commits by the folks who voted no was their disrespect These are both pretty trivial one is fixing a mistaken class name in the docs and the other is just a trivial refactor just a of less that could be reverted with no ill effects 
mdo,2013-04-26 18:10:48,reach out to them and see what I can do We will have to do the same thing for the contributors in Would you be willing to reach out to them as well so we can make that change If you like I can also send the message if you have a list of emails 
nextgenthemes,2013-04-28 22:26:44,I am glad to see like I am not the only person voted no In the email voting there were actually including me One guy went with the I just wanted to make things clear I want to piss someone off here my commit was very trivial indeed but it was lessifying not just indenting to be clear I hope it takes no too much time to revert it If someone else will do the exact same changes after I sue for copyright infringement I promise I try to make it short I believe the is a much superior license to the MIT or other licenses because of the fact it forces a good people to let they code open in every sense of the word It was carefully designed by to address issues like https en wikipedia org wiki Tivoization If you think Bootstrap would never be affected by that well think again With all the mobile devices and mobile apps coming out there is a high possibility I think that some company will develop some app using BS and then locking it down on a hardware basis That would be a sad day least for Thats only one example As stated above just on other words Dual License License compatible with Also note that Apache is Compatible with The thing that i missed was that you downgrade the of course That seems to be a matter for Drupal as I read above since they accept into the repos For WordPress however this is not the case http make wordpress org plugins Could not find anything on themes though Anyway I am doing this to make the point that I strongly believe in the and do not want any code if me even end up locked down somewhere I know why many may think of MIT as just because you can do more with it if you see it that way but for me its the other way around I also think this stay or later for the absolute maximum thinking should be come to an end For sure that would painful at first but later it would be beneficial for the communities If some huge projects would take the lead on that others would be forced to finally upgrade to I would be embarrassed if not all what I said above is true because I actually like lawyer speech and license texts at all and for that matter MIT is short and sweet but there Is a good reason the has long complicated text in it Ok enough could go on for hours I hope understand PS Guess I failed on the Who is the other easy to stand in the crowd but it takes courage to stand alone 
jcheng5,2013-04-29 03:48:02,When I looked at the spreadsheet there were two votes that appeared to be the same person with two different and I could only find one commit for that person I am not a committer to bootstrap so not trying to assert any kind of moral authority here and I hope I come off that way But I would like to give you my perspective as the author of a web framework github com rstudio shiny that is trying to move to or We have large customers that we ignore who have told us that their legal departments do not permit software in their organization but is OK I defend their position but I also have no delusions that I will be able to argue them into changing their policy This leaves us with a decision to either offer them a commercial license or go with a permissive license like BSD which if you are a GPL true believer is almost as bad as a commercial license What we would prefer to offer them is a license I understand the Tivoization concern but it feels like hairsplitting to me when already completely legal to make a derivative work from Bootstrap and it 
nterray,2013-04-29 08:54:41,I fully understand your point However this forbids some project to use bootstrap as nearly impossible for them to migrate to another license than When your code base is more than years old when you have to knock at the door of lawyers of big companies know that they contributed to a FLOSS and when you have to find copyright holders since original commiter is dead then it feels impossible to change the license As said change is to help GPL projects not hurt Those projects need Bootstrap to help them offer a good user experience Without having a compatible license those projects will have to look at other alternatives like Foundation wich does not offer the same level of finish than Bootstrap disappointed

cweagans,2013-05-19 20:35:43,Everything been done has been noted in this issue I had time to spend on this for a while though I may be able to look at it next week while at Drupalcon 
AJ-Acevedo,2013-05-20 16:08:25,One thing that can help is Any contributor reading this Issue that has not already agreed to the move to the MIT License please post here that you agree my preemptive I You guys should totally consider www clahub com for all contributions until the move to MIT is complete 
aristath,2013-05-28 12:23:15,for changing the 
fnwbr,2013-06-17 14:50:47,Would also agree go for it 
vaceletm,2013-06-27 19:22:21,Disclaimer not a lawyer so I might be wrong Try to work about the contribs that might still be a problem sounds already gone as the document was rewritten and as far as I can see there no longer mention of the corresponding modifications modifications seems to also have gone in the multiple rewrite of the file I dig into code base but it seems that there is no blocker to double license to MIT for Did I miss something 
deshipu,2013-06-29 12:28:28,We are currently in the process of improving our theme as a part of a Google Summer of Code student project If there was a definite decision on this possibly a we could go ahead and use Bootstrap The way it is now with no information we will wait a couple more days and then go ahead with a different framework because we afford to stall It would be a great shame though as Bootstrap is perfect for us Is there a definite decision on changing the license and just a question of time to work out all the formalities or is it still up for

ReimarBauer,2013-07-06 09:05:14,Dear all license issues always take long time to get resolved Dual licensing is usually a solution to permit with lesser effort more people access to projects they want to use and to contribute too Please let us know what your current plans cheers Reimar

juthilo,2013-07-16 11:20:35,Could you send me a list of the people rather you already sent emails I have already filtered the log output against the people who already answered the Google Form If I subtracted your list we could send emails to all the contributors to pretty much a newbie to Git though so I know if the way of really getting all authors I filtered out duplicates and some obvious alternate email addresses Any new thoughts from or Especially about the 
cweagans,2013-07-18 22:23:20,The people send emails to are listed on the second sheet of https docs google com spreadsheet git log is acceptable for determining who contributed 
juthilo,2013-07-18 22:31:56,Perfect start working on that tomorrow 
mdo,2013-07-19 03:23:20,Let me know how I can help 
juthilo,2013-07-19 05:32:14,send the emails to new contributors and then see where problems arise 
juthilo,2013-07-19 09:24:16,Hi If any of you would like to keep track of the progress or help I use docs google com spreadsheet to track responses etc Anybody can comment so if you find anything email address response given via GitHub else just type it in there and fix it 
vaceletm,2013-07-19 11:55:42,the two red should probably be amended as the code they contributed seems already rewritten in me comment https github com twitter bootstrap issues Maybe worst adding a note about that 
garvincasimir,2013-07-19 13:55:00,I got your email for the first time this morning I thought it was spam because i understand why a random gmail address was contacting me about legal issues related to bootstrap issues This may be something to consider for other people who have not responded By the way I voted 
retlehs,2013-07-19 17:09:50,i answered but the spreadsheet is showing for my email 
juthilo,2013-07-19 17:15:46,That spreadsheet is updated manually patch you in later today See previous post by for link to actual response spreadsheet

gstein,2013-07-27 22:06:39,not a lawyer so how the heck would I know the case law and But got a long history with licensing and handling questions just like this Look This thread is that you cannot simply take software and change the license on it You need the copyright permission Thus you cannot software provided to you under MIT BSD whatever Go check with your lawyers tell you the same thing You own it so you change the license on it You can offer the whole Drupal package under but those underlying libraries will still be MIT and BSD and and whatever This issue is the same gather all copyright permission in order to change the license but the entire headache of this issue is premised on believing the FSF rather than the ASF along with strange preconceptions on how licenses behave within combined works and the redistribution of underlying components 
sun,2013-07-27 22:20:51,I am not a lawyer but the confusion is easy to spot MIT and BSD can be relicensed as That true You cannot relicense anything If not the copyright holder then you cannot slap a different license on somebody code That code remains under whatever license it was provided with That statement was certainly meant in the sense of making code that adheres to a very relaxed license compatible to a much more restrictive license The of licenses essentially boils down to exactly that If the original license A essentially grants you to do you MIT then it is inherently compatible with a license B which may enforce further policies on you The focus is on license compatibility not relicensing The relicensing aspect only plays a role for the current Bootstrap project itself but not for its potential future consumers The relicensing work requires explicit approval from all Bootstrap contributors That is because this is essentially the reverse of above mentioned process A more restrictive license is changed to a more relaxed license Therefore all current copyright holders need to explicitly agree to the loss of their intellectual property rights This is exactly what this very issue tries to accomplish and it looks like making good progress Long story short and BSD can be relicensed as was meant in terms of license compatibility The ultimate goal here is to allow projects licensed under the GPL to include Bootstrap as part of their distributions This means that a project being distributed under a more license g is able to include code being distributed under a more license g The requirements of the permissive license are fully the intellectual property work is distributed in a way that complies with the requirements of the original license The relicensing aspect in this compatibility scenario would not play role at all if the GPL would not explicitly require all code to be licensed under the GPL too Only because of this aspect any code that is distributed with code that is licensed under the GPL is automatically licensed under the GPL too Further redistribution under the GPL is the exact point where compatibility turns into relicensing That is only possible if the original license of included code libraries is more permissive and compatible with the more restrictive license This idea and process of compatible licenses is not it is used in literally all software that you are using g the very software that you use to access this HTML web This effort here is about changing the license and intellectual property rights of Bootstrap contributors only As you noted yourself such a change requires explicit approval from all contributors That is the very core of this issue That is what is happening in here right now With very promising results 
gstein,2013-07-27 22:32:03,Yes I am aware of all that As I said been doing this for many many years You stated redistribution under the GPL is the exact point where compatibility turns into relicensing but that true either The is under the GPL The underlying libraries are relicensed That was the problem that I was pointing out to there is no relicensing going on in Drupal That is an incorrect use of the phrase Yes this issue is about relicensing Bootstrap and I recognize that is entirely different from the combined work terminology above I have a problem with people who believe they cannot incorporate code into their codebase Bootstrap have to go through all this pain 
sun,2013-07-27 22:49:35,I can perfectly see where coming The exact interpretation of combined work is under the has been left to plenty of lawyers around the unfortunately with conflicting results The FSF the and are The Apache Software Foundation they are You seem to prefer and believe in the interpretation of the ASF instead of the interpretation of the FSF At the same time I still believe Santa Claus is brown and not red and can prove so with facts Others wholeheartedly showing excellent facts too Who 
gstein,2013-07-27 23:03:25,Eben Moglen asked the ASF not to make the compatibility assertion on our he said that would be equivalent to the ASF telling people to infringe their copyright We gave up on the discussions it was consuming a of time We punted and waited for for the FSF to make a statement of compatibility But none of that denies the tortuous arguments that Eben FSF went through to reach their regarding The ASF disagrees but feel like pushing it We probably have pushed it if simply to avoid painful processes like what is happening in this issue back in how would we have Bootstrap have to feel like relicensing to MIT is required Especially just because the FSF website 
sun,2013-07-27 23:49:35,Thanks for the backstory At this point in history however this just means that some people believe Santa Claus is purple I still believe brown but the vast majority of people interprets him as red As long as the original author does not clarify on the matter all of this are speculations only In this concrete case speculations by lawyers The more you pay them the more you believe you can trust their interpretation Given a history of years of trying to get a clarification on the matter without results it is only sensible for a project like Bootstrap to choose the path of least resistance and ultimate clarity Relicensing the work to MIT Expat inherently eliminates the entire drama what doing here Focus on opportunity Being able to use it as part of their distributions is what ultimately matters for a giant amount of potential users Who really cares for the ASF FSF interpretation What kind of issue are you trying to This very issue here or a very abstract licensing issue that no one wants to get involved with in the first 
gstein,2013-07-28 01:02:05,My point is that Bootstrap have to go through this pain IOW simply close this issue and leave it as Nobody can demonstrate a conflict beyond website says Save a lot of effort that has been predicated on one very arguable declaration from a decade ago 
torstenfabricius,2013-07-28 01:18:21,Hi Greg I think you miss the point For me in person it makes not any difference if Bootstrap is or or MIT when I want to USE it in ONE of my projects BUT it is relevant when I and the community I am committed with want to distribute it in our software as implemented preset default as a few other software communities want to do aswell We all cannot ship Bootstrap with our software as our are licenced with the LGPL which simply cannot be to the stronger GPL or AL Thus it is up to the Bootstrap community to deside wether it is useful for the community and the further development of Bootstrap on the one hand and webdesign on the other hand if the Bootstrap community gives all these projects the opportunity to ship it preconfigured or not The majority of the Bootstrap community did deside that it would be better to allow those projects to ship it by dual licensing instead of not allowing us by keeping a single AL licence model I am looking forward to use Bootstrap in my future projects without the need of either multiple times of implementation or researching for alternatives So do a lot of other people Greetz Torsten Am schrieb Greg Stein My point is that Bootstrap have to go through this pain IOW simply close this issue and leave it as Nobody can demonstrate a conflict beyond website says Save a lot of effort that has been predicated on one very arguable declaration from a decade ago 
gstein,2013-07-28 01:48:48,Oh I hear you We all want to be able to use and combine open free components into the stuff we build Totally agree on that part I simply question your belief that you cannot incorporate code into your LGPL or GPL combined works or do it in a heartbeat without worry Why do believe that your project cannot incorporate thus what is preventing you from using Bootstrap in your make this even more concrete say you use Bootstrap in your project Do you honestly believe the Bootstrap people are going to knock on your door and say violating the license we put onto Bootstrap you be using it that way Do you think they will that to downstream 
ZDroid,2013-07-28 10:50:33,Avoid this discussion as thing where you talk to law Here is place to chose to use or use MIT license in BS Greg Stein Oh I hear you github com We all want to be able to use and combine open free components into the stuff we build Totally agree on that part I simply question your belief that you cannot incorporate code into your LGPL or GPL combined works or do it in a heartbeat without worry Why do believe that your project cannot incorporate thus what is preventing you from using Bootstrap in your make this even more concrete say you use Bootstrap in your project Do you honestly believe the Bootstrap people are going to knock on your door and say violating the license we put onto Bootstrap you be using it that way Do you think they will that to downstream 
jrobeson,2013-07-28 08:36:57,whether the problem is real or not i do know one thing The apache license is a blocker for using bootstrap in zencart themes and drupal themes both teams have made public statements regarding the usage of apache licensed components in their repositories If one wants to distribute a bootstrap based theme then person who installs the theme must acquire the bootstrap files and install them EDIT looks like i lied about the zencart statement being public for some reason this page on the forum is protected 
gstein,2013-07-28 09:34:56,no no a simple mistake rather than that term is much too harsh please worry Go ahead and ask those teams about the basis for their public statements Please see if you can find a or a of the problem with incorporating code into zencart or drupal be very In short is permissive so why do you believe it 
draftkraft,2013-07-28 10:29:28,imho the question is not whether YOU see any problem with integrating an into a project but whether there is a POTENTIAL legal issue because the situation is not clear vs Apache and the legal SECURITY for someone using a software that does integrate both licenses And that one a person or any if using such software runs into the RISK to use sell provide software or services with potential legal issues I agree that the bootstrap project in this case will not sue anyone if he does so their intension seems clear But any developer contributing to bootstrap COULD sue that one and further any competition of the one COULD sue him because they could accuse him to violate a license and distort competition The potential legal risk that arises from that fact could discourage someone or in doing it Think of Google Adobe and others even must not be such big global players could be local players will not use such software because they could end up in a legal conflict costing them millions of dollars euros whatever for lawyers penalties compensation etc Further the legal interpretation of the situation could be interpreted differently in every country Can you guarantee this will not I wonder why you are arguing that hard against that it you the one saying that this only blocks time that could be invested So the bootstrap projects has wisely chosen a way to avoid legal problems and provide legal secure That is Why are you blocking time of people continuously asking them for that took a decision based on their proprietary needs and keep telling the same thing without the will to understand or accept the situation or circumstances other or are acting 
gstein,2013-07-28 10:57:24,Heh not blocking anybody could I hope or want Just hoping people stop think and understand what and why this course of action is being taken There are a lot of comments in this issue that lead me to believe there is a general misunderstanding of how code BSD gets combined into a larger work And that moving from to MIT somehow helps that purported Note my posts have consumed a couple hours of time This issue and its efforts have consumed at least hundred hours or more And it even complete btw you may want to read up on the cannot sue for license violation 
gstein,2013-07-28 11:08:18,btw if like to talk about potential legal risks then I would ask you why the MIT license is It does not explicitly speak to any of the rights in USC You only that a court will interpret the MIT language favorably with respect to Modern licenses like and have taken into account the terminology and case law regarding recent copyright code 
jrobeson,2013-07-29 21:39:42,https drupal org node 
gstein,2013-07-29 23:09:50,thanks already saw that in a comment earlier but I took your pointer as an implicit request to post there so I did 
juthilo,2013-07-30 13:26:40,Just to keep up to date I have just sent out emails to all the people which included a URL to the form Motto clicks less than minutes Certainly did pay off in terms of incoming responses 
pmclanahan,2013-07-30 13:57:19,IANAL But my take is that the Apache license is superior because it provides some patent protection The GPL seems to exist to force developers to adopt the license or force them not to use the software For something claiming freedom there seems to be a lot of force going around including attempting to force Bootstrap to adopt a license that is not of their choice My opinion is that if a project like Drupal wants to use truly free software perhaps they should set their software truly free had to avoid many libraries over the years because of the GPL so I just bring myself to be sympathetic especially since users of Drupal are in no way affected by this and can easily include Bootstrap themselves 
mainerror,2013-07-30 14:07:22,This issue is about migrating Bootstrap to the license not GPL license or some sort of APL vs GPL holy war 
pmclanahan,2013-07-30 14:19:14,I know My comment was in regards to the GPL project attempting to force others to in some way modify their licensing or behavior to do what they feel is right I simply disagree The Bootstrap project chose a license that they liked and are now being asked to change it Software is licensed GPL in order to prevent certain classes of people from using it I just dislike all of that very much 
pmclanahan,2013-07-30 14:44:20,All that said contributed all of a single line change to Bootstrap so my opinion should likely not count for much and the vast majority seem cool with the change This is just me shaking my single tiny fist in the air 
torstenfabricius,2013-07-30 16:05:47,Hi Paul what do you Do you dislike that the Bootstrap project is asked to which should allow certain classes of people to use it aswell default integration in MIT or LGPL software for or do you dislike that software is licensed GPL in order to prevent certain classes of people from using Torsten Am schrieb Paul McLanahan github com I know My comment was in regards to the GPL project attempting to force others to in some way modify their licensing or behavior to do what they feel is right I simply disagree The Bootstrap project chose a license that they liked and are now being asked to change it Software is licensed GPL in order to prevent certain classes of people from using it I just dislike all of that very much Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub github com twbs bootstrap issues 
pmclanahan,2013-07-30 17:05:48,I consider using the to be a class of people a bit of code choosing to be exclusive and therefore being excluded by their own decision also likely that they could safely include Apache licensed code without issue but a difference of opinion The of would I think be Drupal users or people developing with Drupal and in no way restricted by the Apache license As far as the project class they are the one who made the GPL choice Had they wanted to be able to include code licensed under other licenses have selected a different license I do dislike the latter I think applying the term to GPL licensed code is a bit of a misnomer in that you can use it w o modification but if you choose to change it then they force a licensing decision on you So while free in the beginning it takes away the freedom of future developers to license their own work as they choose This is why called a license It also quite often means that developers in corporations use the project Some like this aspect but rather err on the side of helping my fellow programmer than hurting companies The Apache license is extremely permissive for all uses but the GPL dislikes that where I see the difference The intricacies of are over my head just generally opposed to a project bending to the whim of a project simply because they chose a restrictive license that is now biting them back and because I like the Apache license MIT is also great but offers nothing in the realm of patents which are unfortunately a big deal these days Yes to both though I disagree with the wording of the former 
marclaporte,2013-08-04 16:54:53,thanks for starting this thanks for recent push to get approvals from contributors Here are stats from the tracking spreadsheet as of now Number of contributors OK No Problem reaching them Waiting for answer are new contributors in and only recently have been Of those who answer agree For those who disagree of we can rewrite their contributions There are new committers all the time This is great but making this never ending Would there be a way to ask people to accept as they do their first 
pmclanahan,2013-08-05 01:53:14,Just to be clear while a vote I want to block the will of the majority Clearly a vast majority is cool with this so fine with that I just wanted to make my feelings known on the matter since you asked But if the will of the bootstrap contributor community then I stand in the way 
marclaporte,2013-08-05 03:16:28,Thanks 
marclaporte,2013-08-05 04:09:34,So there was quite a bit of work on this today by Julian and myself The current tally stands at Number of contributors OK No new request was sent out and graciously accepted to change their Problem problems have been Wait are more recent contributors in and only have been contacted less than a week ago and we are waiting for the votes to come in

barryvdh,2013-08-05 09:30:41,Looks good but the first mail days just asked for my opinion so it really clear that you actually needed my permission mail was a lot clearer about that so I filled it But perhaps it could have been a little bit more clear why this is a big issue 
marclaporte,2013-08-05 17:35:35,Number of contributors OK No more graciously accepted to This represents commits Problem problems have been Wait are waiting for the OKs to come in We are now at acceptance rate for those who voted

lsmith77,2013-09-30 12:43:40,That should not be too hard There is a UI that you could use if you would be willing to do it manually Alternatively if you have the current data in some SQL DB import you could write a query to do it 
rhodrykorb,2013-09-30 12:45:20,It is all currently in Google Spreadsheets Also noting it is not just up to me either 
lsmith77,2013-09-30 12:49:36,should not be too hard to get that into an SQL DB export csv sql 
UTCWebDev,2013-09-30 14:31:02,GNU org states www gnu org licenses note that this license is not compatible with GPL version because it has some requirements that are not in that GPL version These include certain patent termination and indemnification provisions The patent termination provision is a good thing which is why we recommend the Apache license for substantial programs over other lax permissive licenses Compatibility issues vs legality seems is OK with themes plugins etc incorporating wordpress org themes search Not sure about WP core 
gstein,2013-09-30 19:26:46,as I said just taking the word for it That statement was placed there by Eben a decade ago and the ASF maintains he is incorrect We just got tired of arguing with him in hindsight we should have persisted to avoid situations like So you have no real idea what this purported is other than what the FSF tells you And as a result people are blowing a lot of time and effort attempting to relicense based on an arguable statement on a website from a decade ago I have yet to see anybody provide a specific reason why Bootstrap could not be included in Drupal other under its existing license

gstein,2013-09-30 20:00:44,It violate either GPL But your choice about your time effort 
UTCWebDev,2013-09-30 20:08:56,Full disclosure I voted for dual license However the Drupal distribution issue is a red herring to see if your library is already included in the list of existing whitelist entries If not verify that the license of the library is one of the following GPL and later LGPL and later of these GPL and www gnu org licenses Existing distribution https drupal org project flight Existing module https drupal org project Existing theme https drupal org project bootstrap Therefore should be for Drupal distribution Also plenty of precedent in Joomla and WordPress Templates themes components galore 
stuartpb,2013-10-10 22:32:47,For the subject of projects looking to include Bootstrap that need a has anybody considered writing a that include the clause developers can use the code in closed but does include patent termination indemnification clauses it sounds like could be from 
cweagans,2013-10-10 22:36:20,http xkcd com comes to mind 
stuartpb,2013-10-10 23:03:42,A new license like a new standard intending to cover use though Licenses work that you need different licensing terms to cover different restrictions have different restrictions because different people need to make different for instance if you want to release code and receive contributions back using the MIT license be appropriate in a culture where most developers keep substantial modifications proprietary like systems Meanwhile on the Web code usually receives a few tweaks and is uploaded to the public in source form so allowing a few outliers to keep their changes proprietary hurt A proposed set of terms would cover a small portion of use cases that currently exists Linus Torvalds objects to the clause in but like slashdot org topic cloud but have an appropriate document to express them is why Linux is still on the despite its lack of protection against patent 
mdo,2013-10-10 23:33:34,If you want to have that discussion go for it just do it here please D 
stuartpb,2013-10-10 23:36:53,Suggestion as to where such a discussion could be 
mdo,2013-10-10 23:38:55,talking about new licenses independent of this framework happen here The consensus has been to move to MIT and well under way Just seems like the two discussions are not related especially to the people watching this thread 
stuartpb,2013-10-11 01:33:00,Searching around it looks like there an existing forum for this sort of discussion so made a Google Group https groups google com forum nonlawyers And to answer my initial question at the bottom of the page for the it says is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document but changing it is not allowed Which I take it means derivative works are illegal other words the GPL itself is published under a 
gstein,2013-10-12 09:34:19,Correct derivative works of the GPL license are not allowed The authors have not granted that right to you others I would state that is a Good Thing There are already too many FLOSS licenses and that creates problems Attempting to create a new derivative license is not very helpful users and lawyers have to examine it and its combinatorics with other licenses IMO choose or try and create something new For licensing discussions in terms of applications combinations interpretations etc the org mailing list has lots of eyeballs and lots of history nine years And yes it even includes some lawyers who contribute to the discussion but not to provide official advice See http apache org for archives It all Apache licensing but certainly tends towards issues and its relationship with other licenses 
mirabilos,2013-11-19 13:07:23,Is git master already under MIT or will there be a commit effectively switching the licence only in the asking because I need to use this with FusionForge which is a huge legacy codebase which is mostly but with some parts thus will not work for it
